# Bid-Sorting-System---Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
This C++ project demonstrates a modular bid management system that loads, displays, and sorts auction bid data from a CSV file. It features a menu-driven interface and implements two classic sorting algorithms; Selection Sort and QuickSort to compare performance and efficiency when sorting bids by title.

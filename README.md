# Bid-Sorting-System---Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
This C++ project demonstrates a modular bid management system that loads, displays, and sorts auction bid data from a CSV file. It features a menu-driven interface and implements two classic sorting algorithms; Selection Sort and QuickSort to compare performance and efficiency when sorting bids by title. 
# Code reflection/summary
This program is designed to load, display, and sort the bid data from a municipal government data feed that contains bids submitted from property auctions in the CSV file. The program used two different algorithms when sorting the selection sort and quick sort. It provided a menu driven interface that allows the users to load the bids, view the bids, select sort the bids, and quick sort through the bids. They can also view and compare the performance of the sorting methods by viewing the execution time. The code uses the bid object to encapsulate bid details and leverages the CSVparser library to read and parse the CSV data. Sorting is performed based on the title field of each bid. 
During the development of this code, one of the challenges that I ran into was ensuring that the CSV file was correctly located and accessible during runtime. I found that the first few runs I had misplaced the CSV files, and they were not accessible by the program resulting in a crash giving me the error message of “file not found”. This was resolved by placing the CSV file in the same directory as the executable and verifying the filename matches. Another challenge was managing the scope and avoiding redefinition when variables were reused across the menu options. I resolved this issue by scoping each sort block with braces and ensuring the cases were properly closed. Implementing the sorting algorithms required attention to the index boundaries and logic comparison. Overall, the program demonstrates a practical use of algorithmic techniques and a strong modular design!
